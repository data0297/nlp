# Final project rules

## General

Find a partner to form a group and define a final project and carry out a month long research and implementation. Group size can vary from 1-3. The final project will be delivered in a presentation and a paper. You should produce a paper that you can aim to submit to a conference for publication (although one month is definitely not enough for that, but thatâ€™s the direction of the goal we are trying to achieve here).

There are several types of final project:

- solve a well defined NLP task using a dataset and compare several different methods (training models from scratch or fine tuning LLM pretrained models)
- using prompt engineering for LLM to solve a NLP task
- [Location Extraction project (NER)](https://tufts.box.com/s/s1wjl7dbca7inhc7fbmjuxgf4445cghw) from Prof Alice Mello
- exploratory analysis of text data (see NLP4DH below)
- replicate a research paper
- propose a new method on a task
- etc.

No matter the type of project, in each project:

- You must explore the use of a novel method that was not covered in this class, and this is something that you should do research on and learn about yourself. This could also be exploring a new task that was not covered in detail in class and explore methods to be applied to that task.
- The co-authors must each contribute at least one novel method to be used in this project and final paper
- The paper should compare several methods/approaches to a simple baseline and report back the results.
- You should have a limited scope to be able to finish within about 1 month.
- Time estimation. For instance, how long do you plan to do literature review, data collection and curation, writing code, etc. This is just to make sure you have a realistic chance of finishing a project in a month. For instance, if the problem you want to solve involves a very long process of data collection, you might need to think about whether you have time to finish it.
- Think about how you will evaluate your methods. If you need annotated ground truth data, think about how you will obtain it.

## Ideas and examples

You are welcome and encouraged to explore your own interest and find your own data sets or build a project around a problem you are interested in. If you have an idea you want to explore, talk to them with your peers and with the professor to develop them and search for relevant resources online to define a limited-scope, practical project to finish within 4-5 weeks. Here are some examples of papers you can read to get an idea of the range of topics NLP researchers are working on.

## Proposal

Components of the project proposal :

- dataset
- data preprocessing/cleaning
- research question
- problem description
- scope
- literature review (1-2 each person)
- methodology (compare several novel methods not covered in class to a simple baseline)
- evaluation
- error analysis
- timeline estimation

Final project will be delivered in the form of a presentation and a paper, not code.

The proposal submission is through Canvas. Please upload a PDF or Word file.

In your proposal, you can cover some of these aspects but no need to cover all of them at the time of writing the proposal. The proposal should primarily focus on the research question, problem description and motivation, dataset / data acquisition plan, and define the scope, planned literature review, etc.

## Grading : total 40 points

- Paper formatting and style (The main paper content excluding the references should be minimum 4 pages, max 6 pages, in a two column format. The paper should be formatted using Latex or Word template found [here](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/style_and_formatting/)) (5)
- Result & discussion (Is there a thorough discussion on results and observations, error analysis , etc.?) (5)
- In-class presentation (Does the in class presentation clearly discuss the motivation, problem formulation, data set, and proposed methods? ) (5)
- Literature review (thoroughly review and explain relevant existing work in this domain) (5)
- Technical Correctness (is the technical solution correct?) (5)
- Novelty/difficulty (how novel is this idea? How challenging is this project to pull off? This is correlated with how much work in put in. If you work on an easy problem, I expect you to put in more work, trying out more complicated methods, etc. But if you work on a hard problem, I can understand if you managed to get worse performance, or didn't have time to try out more complicated models ) (5)
- Experimental Validation (is there sufficient experimental validation to support the main claim or conclusion?) (5)
- Clarity of Writing (is the paper easily readable, can a reader easily understand what has been done? try to be specific about what you've done) (5)
- In the final paper, in the last section of the main text, please include an "Acknowledgement" section to describe the contribution of each co-author of this paper.

For final paper submission, please upload a pdf file of the paper to Canvas (I will create an Assignment for final paper submission). Meanwhile, upload your code that you used for the final project to the course Github repo under your branch.
