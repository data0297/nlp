- **Think Small: When your LLM needs to go on diet or Less is More: Intelligence of Small Language Models** 
  - **Abstract**: The current hype is all about LLMs and how many generic tasks it can perform. The quality of an LLM is determined by how well it can generalize over multiple tasks. It is also assessed in terms of how quick it can come up with an answer and the how satisfying it seems to the user. As a result it uses a lot of GPU/CPU compute and in some cases costs extra to access a better model. SLMs demand is to offset these costs and get to a better space where the inferencing can be done utilizing lesser compute for better results.
  - **Speaker Bio**: Sindhuja Thogarrati is a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Bose Corporation. She works with the ML research and product teams to optimize and profile audio ML algorithms on new hardware. Currently, she is working on ML research in the acoustics modeling domain. Her technical interest is in audio, speech and text processing on edge devices. In her previous career, she developed enterprise level solutions using NLP. Sindhuja holds a Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science from the University of Houston, and is currently an industry mentor at Tufts AIDA lab.
